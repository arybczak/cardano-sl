## What is Cardano SL?

Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper ["Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol"](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#9BKRHCSI) by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.

You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws. Please read ["What Makes Cardano SL Special?"](https://cardanodocs.com/introduction/#what-makes-cardano-sl-special) for more info about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin. 

### Beyond Settlement Layer

Cardano SL is called a “Layer” for a reason. It’s the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are useful for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. The application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, which is the Cardano SL [wallet application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus), into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.

## Platform support

Supported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux. There are [installers for Windows and macOS](https://daedaluswallet.io/#download), which include a main node and [Daedalus wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus). Linux installer is going to be released soon.

## Building from source

Cardano SL is written in Haskell, so [Haskell Tool Stack](https://haskellstack.org) is required. Furthermore, we strongly suggest using [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) to get the correct dependencies for building Cardano SL. The following commands assume that you already has `stack` and `nix-*` programs:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/cardano-sl.git
$ cd cardano-sl
$ ./util-scripts/build.sh
```

Please refer to [this page of the documentation](https://cardanodocs.com/for-contributors/building-from-source/) for technical details.

### Binaries

There are set of Cardano SL components as a result of building. This set includes the main node for Cardano SL network and different helper tools. Please read [this page of the documentation](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/cli-options/) for technical details.
